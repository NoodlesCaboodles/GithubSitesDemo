# GithubSitesDemo
A github sites demo repository created as a tutorial for the University of Chicago Engineering Society

## Instructions
### Step 1: Fork this repository
Use the fork button in the upper right corner of the github website. This creates a copy of this repository under your account.

### Step 2: Clone your repository
You can do this by going to a command line on your computer and typing "git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/GithubSitesDemo.git" in the folder you want to 

### Step 3: Open and Edit the files
You can do this in any text editor. I prefer VSCode, but even notepad will do. If you want to see what your website looks like while you're editing it, just open your index.html file and it should pop open in your web browser. This is not on the internet, just showing you what your site will look like when you put this file online.

### Step 4: Add and Commit
Type "git status" in the command line to see files that you have changed. Type "git add FILENAME" to add a changed file to your next commit. This is called staging.
Then, type "git commit -m "TYPE A COMMIT MESSAGE HERE, NOT THIS MESSAGE BUT A REAL INFORMATIVE MESSAGE"

### Step 5: Push
Type "git push" in the command line to push all of your commits to the github website. You do not have to push after every commit, but if you don't push, then github will not recieve your changes until you do. After you push, you should be able to see your changes in the code on the github website. Your github site should update automatically after a few moments.
